# Weather Forecasting Using API with Python

## Overview
This project provides a weather forecasting system using a weather API and Python. The system fetches real-time weather data from an external API and displays it in a user-friendly format. It's perfect for users who want to stay updated with the latest weather conditions.

## Features
- Real-time weather updates
- Weather forecasts for multiple locations
- Easy-to-use command-line interface
- Customizable output for specific weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- An API key from a weather service provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-forecasting-api.git
    cd weather-forecasting-api
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Get your API key from the weather service provider and add it to a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    echo "API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the weather forecasting script:
    ```bash
    python forecast.py
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to enter the location for which you want to get the weather forecast.

## Customization
To customize the weather forecasting system, follow these steps:
1. Open `config.py` and modify the settings as needed.
2. Update the `forecast.py` script to fetch additional weather parameters or change the output format.
